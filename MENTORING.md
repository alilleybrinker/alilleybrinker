# Mentoring! :school:

I am a Rust mentor, which means I'm available to help people new to the
Rust programming language to navigate the community and achieve their
goals! You can learn more about how this works on the [Awesome Rust
Mentors][mentor] page.

Key ideas:

* I'll be your friend and guide, a constant cheerleader, and help you
  to achieve your goals in whatever ways I can.
* I'll provide constructive feedback, pass on things I've learned from
  working in open source, and encourage you to engage actively in the
  community.
* Be as responsive as possible, ideally less than a day for some sort
  of response, even if it's to let you know that I've noticed you but
  can't reply in full right now.
* Introduce you to other Rustaceans, so you can get connected to people
  and topics in your particular areas of interest.

## About Me

I've used Rust since before version 1.0. Most of my contributions have
been around documentation and teaching, including:

* Writing most of the now-defunct official [Frequently Asked Questions][faq] page.
* Contributing improvements to the [Advanced Rust Programming Language][nomicon] book.
* Speaking at Rust Belt Rust 2016, with a talk titled ["Hello and Welcome â€” Documentation in the Rust Ecosystem."][rbr16]
* Teaching Rust as part of an [undergraduate course on programming language theory][course] at California State University, San Bernardino.
* Speaking at Rust Conf 2017, with a talk titled ["A Tale of Teaching Rust."][rc17]
* Teaching Rust at my current employer, [MITRE][mitre]. [(We're hiring!)][hiring]

## How I Run My Mentoring

My preferred communication channel is Twitter. It's what I check consistently and
where I'm most responsive. If you're interested in becoming a mentee of mine, reach
out via Twitter Direct Message. My username is [@alilleybrinker][twitter].

I limit the number of mentees I'll take on at once to keep things manageable and
make sure I can give people the attention they need. If I have an active mentee
who no longer needs as much engagement, I'll move them to "alumni" status and usually
open up another mentoring slot.

## Before I Add a Mentee

There are some things I want to know about any possible mentees. I'll ask these questions
before taking anyone on:

1. What name should I call you?
2. What are your preferred pronouns?
3. Why are you interested in Rust?
4. Have you used Rust or attempted to use Rust before?
5. Are there any technical areas you're interested in applying Rust to?

## Code of Conduct

All communications between me and any mentees are subject to the [Rust Code of Conduct][coc],
and any issues or disputes will be resolved with the involvement of the Rust Moderation
Team if necessary.
