# Hi, I'm Andrew! :wave:

I work on software security at [MITRE][mitre] by day and teach, write, and blog about Rust at night!

My main interests are in how we make software safer and more secure, including:

* :speech_balloon: Building safer / more secure languages
* :mag_right: Static and dynamic code analysis
* :scroll: Formal methods (proving things safe!)
* :package: Software supply chain security

I blog about the [Rust programming language][rust] at [PossibleRust.com][poss].
