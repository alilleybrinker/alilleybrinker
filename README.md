# Hi, I'm Andrew! :wave:

Here's some of what I do:

- 🔧 Work on software supply chain security at [MITRE][mitre].
- 🦀 Teach at [Possible Rust][poss].
- 🗨️ Keep a [list of languages written in Rust][langs].
- ⁉️ Maintain [woah][woah], a better `Result` type.

Other projects looking for collaborators include:

- [`cargo-migrate`][migrate], so library authors can help their users update to new APIs automatically.
- [`tin`][tin], a project to learn how to implement a real-world programming language.
- [`skej`][skej], a little tool for analysis of transactions and concurrent scheduling.
- [`tcalc`][tcalc], a little duration calculator tool

In the past, I...

- 🖋️ [Wrote the old Rust FAQ](https://github.com/rust-lang/prev.rust-lang.org/pull/202).
- 🎒 [Spoke at RustConf 2017 about teaching Rust in a programming language theory class](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PhfaFkzdBA).
