# Hi, I'm Andrew! :wave:

I work on software security at [MITRE][mitre] by day and teach, write, and blog about
Rust at night!

## Rust :crab:

I've been writing [Rust][rust] since 2013, and I write and teach it professionally. I
also run [Possible Rust][poss], a site for learning Rust, sharing patterns, and exploring
real-world code. I've spoken at conferences, taught Rust at a university, and contributed
to Rust's documentation. I love teaching and mentoring, and am happy to answer questions
about Rust (usually on Twitter). I'm also available for [mentoring][mentoring_page].

## Software Security :wrench:

For my day job, I work in software security, which is all about how to make software
safer and more secure. This may at any point include:

* :speech_balloon: Building safer / more secure languages
* :mag_right: Static and dynamic code analysis
* :scroll: Formal methods (proving things safe!)
* :package: Software supply chain security
