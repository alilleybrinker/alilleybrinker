## Hi, I'm [Andrew][me]! :wave:

I am a Principal Engineer at __[MITRE][mitre]__, where I work on a few different things:

- ⚠️ Support the development of CVE, the world's largest system for tracking vulnerabilities in software and hardware.
- 🔍 Lead the development of __[Hipcheck][hipcheck]__, a tool for automated supply chain risk assessment of software repositories.
- 🖇️ Contribute to __[OmniBOR][omnibor]__ (formerly GitBOM), a standard and tooling for recording build inputs for software artifacts.

### Sometimes I Write

- 🗒️ Write on my __[personal blog][meblog]__ about topics like memory safety, open source software, and software supply chain security.
- 🦀 Write at __[Possible Rust][poss]__ with intermediate-level articles teaching what's possible in the Rust programming language.

### Slightly Less Big Things

- 🗨️ Keep a __[list of languages written in Rust][langs]__.
- ⁉️ Maintain __[woah][woah]__, a `Result` type that separates errors you can handle from errors you can't.
- 🏷️ Maintain __[semver-explain][semver-explain]__, a CLI tool for explaining SemVer requirements.
- 🛑 Maintain __[replace_err][replace_err]__, which adds a `replace_err` method for `Result`.
- 🏗️ Maintain __[pathbuf][pathbuf]__, a convenient macro for building `PathBuf`s.
- 🪄 Created __[FindCargo.cmake][findcargo]__, a CMake module for interoperating with Cargo.
- ⏲️ Wrote __[dcalc][dcalc]__, a CLI duration calculator.
- 🐱 Wrote __[good-cat][good-cat]__, a cat that hates pipes.
- 📎 Wrote __[gccarch][gccarch]__, a tool for getting info on GCC's supported architectures.
- 📆 Wrote __[skej][skej]__, a little analyzer for concurrent schedules.
