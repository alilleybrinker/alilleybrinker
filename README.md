## Hi, I'm [Andrew][me]! :wave:

### Big Things

- 🔍 Lead the development of __[Hipcheck][hipcheck]__, a tool for automated supply chain risk assessment of software repositories.
- 🖇️ Contribute to __[OmniBOR][omnibor]__ (formerly GitBOM), a standard and tooling for recording build inputs for software artifacts.
- 🔧 Work as a Principle Engineer at __[MITRE][mitre]__.

### Sometimes I Write

- 🗒️ Write on my __[personal blog][meblog]__ about topics like memory safety, Rust, open source software, and software supply chain security.
- 🦀 Write at __[Possible Rust][poss]__ (on hiatus).

### Slightly Less Big Things

- 🗨️ Keep a __[list of languages written in Rust][langs]__.
- ⁉️ Maintain __[woah][woah]__, a `Result` type that separates errors you can handle from errors you can't.
- 🏷️ Maintain __[semver-explain][semver-explain]__, a CLI tool for explaining SemVer requirements.
- 🛑 Maintain __[replace_err][replace_err]__, which adds a `replace_err` method for `Result`.
- 🏗️ Maintain __[pathbuf][pathbuf]__, a convenient macro for building `PathBuf`s.
- 🪄 Created __[FindCargo.cmake][findcargo]__, a CMake module for interoperating with Cargo.
- ⏲️ Wrote __[dcalc][dcalc]__, a CLI duration calculator.
- 🐱 Wrote __[good-cat][good-cat]__, a cat that hates pipes.
- 📎 Wrote __[gccarch][gccarch]__, a tool for getting info on GCC's supported architectures.
- 📆 Wrote __[skej][skej]__, a little analyzer for concurrent schedules.

### Things I'd Like to Get To

- 🖨️ Building __[cargo-spdx][cargo-spdx]__, a tool for generating SPDX Software Bills of Materials for Rust builds.
- 🌐 Creating __[Tin][tin]__, a currently ill-defined programming language.
- 📊 Want to build __[epss][epss]__, a library and CLI for interacting with the Exploit Prediction Scoring System API.
- 💭 Want to finish building __[shy][shy]__, a POSIX shell static site generator I can use on [tilde.institute][tilde].
