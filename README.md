# Hi, I'm Andrew! :wave:

__Pronouns: he/him__

Here's some of what I do:

- 🔍 Led the development of [Hipcheck][hipcheck], a tool for automated supply chain risk assessment of software repositories.
- 🔧 Work on software supply chain security at [MITRE][mitre].
- 🎓 Study Computer Science for my MCS at Rice University.
- 🦀 Write at [Possible Rust][poss] (on hiatus while I'm in school).
- 🗨️ Keep a [list of languages written in Rust][langs].
- 🖇️ Contribute to [Omnibor][omnibor] (formerly GitBOM), a standard and tooling for recording build inputs for software artifacts.
- 🖨️ Build [cargo-spdx][cargo-spdx], a tool for generating SPDX Software Bills of Materials for Rust builds.
- ⁉️ Maintain [woah][woah], a `Result` type that separates errors you can handle from errors you can't.
- 🏷️ Maintain [semver-explain][semver-explain], a CLI tool for explaining SemVer requirements.
- 🛑 Maintain [replace_err][replace_err], which adds a `replace_err` method for `Result`.

Plus some less-serious or not-currently-active projects:

- 🌐 Creating [Tin][tin], a currently ill-defined programming language.
- ⏲️ Maintain [dcalc][dcalc], a CLI duration calculator.
- 🐱 Maintain [good-cat][good-cat], a cat that hates pipes.
- 📎 Maintain [gccarch][gccarch], a tool for getting info on GCC's supported architectures.

In the past, I...

- ⛓️ [Built the first FFI interface for Pact](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-reference/pull/97), a framework for testing APIs.
- 🖋️ [Wrote the old Rust FAQ](https://github.com/rust-lang/prev.rust-lang.org/pull/202).
- 👨‍🏫 [Taught programming language theory to undergrads][proglangs].
- 🎒 [Spoke at RustConf 2017 about teaching Rust in a programming language theory class](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PhfaFkzdBA).
- 📖 [Spoke at Rust Belt Rust 2016 about how to write good documentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz2oFEDwiOk).
