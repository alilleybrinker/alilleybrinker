# Hi, I'm Andrew! :wave:

I work on software security at [MITRE][mitre] by day and teach, write, and blog about Rust at night!

My main interests are in how we make software safer and more secure, including:

* :speech_balloon: Building safer / more secure languages
* :mag_right: Static and dynamic code analysis
* :scroll: Formal methods (proving things safe!)
* :package: Software supply chain security

I blog about the [Rust programming language][rust] at [PossibleRust.com][poss].

I'm currently looking for Rust mentees as part of the [Awesome Rust Mentors][mentor] project!
If you're interested in learning Rust and want help navigating the language and community, I'm
happy to work with you! My preferred platform to get started is Twitter; feel free to DM me
([@alilleybrinker][twitter]) if you're interested!

Other things about me:

* I'm passionate about inclusion and diversity, and always trying to learn how to be a better
  ally and supporter of those around me.
* I got my start programming with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by writing themes for iPBfree
  internet forums.

My pronouns are he/him.
